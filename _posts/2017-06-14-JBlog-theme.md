## <FONT COLOR=white>About TDA :

<u><b><FONT COLOR=white>Topological Data Analysis</b></u> is a very recent field in data science.

<FONT COLOR=white>First researches began in 2000 and are mostly directed by an <b>INRIA</b> researcher <a href="https://geometrica.saclay.inria.fr/team/Fred.Chazal/">Frédéric Chazal.</a>

<FONT COLOR=white>It consists in deducing with several math concept some information about <u>the shape of our data</u>.
